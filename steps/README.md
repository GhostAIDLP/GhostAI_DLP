Now we are on the place where we have a prompt scanner working so thats good, however now thinking about making this demoable,
and getting a genuine product out, currently we are working on wrapping this as an sdk and now we gotta conduct alot of user interviews

Where we are now:
User Interviews:
PANW Engineers think Umija and interns and my team, easily 8 ppl
Iskander, Alex, DT could be good warm intros to have in back pocket
Colgate Alums + Network think Remi and Victor

Thesis: Build the n(ngfw) for genai 

Where we are now currenlty a basic proxy thats wrapping oss scanners and github actions scanner could be good for data analysis

Architecture???

CURRENT ROADBLOCKERS:
Dependancy Issues when tryin to run the SDK

Environment and Dependancy Issues:
1) Installing via pip install -e '.[dev]' caused dependency mismatches with preinstalled Anaconda packages.
2) numpy 2.x broke binary compatibility with packages like scipy, h5py, thinc, and streamlit (which expect <2.0).
3) protobuf 5.x also conflicted with packages like grpcio-status expecting <5.
4) python-dotenv was outdated (0.21.0) and flagged as incompatible (>=1.0 required).
5) Missing Dependancies flask-rq2, rq, python-dotenv>=1.0.

Runtime and Module Issues:
1) ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scanners' → occurred because Python couldn’t resolve the relative import structure (src/ghostai/scanners not recognized as a package).
2) ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic' — even though it was listed in pyproject.toml, it wasn’t properly linked to the active environment.
3) 403 Forbidden: This authentication method does not have sufficient permissions to call Inference Providers on behalf of user RadwanJama — your HF token lacks the inference:write or inference:execute scope

Binary Level Incompabilities:
1) NumPy / SpaCy crash: ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility.
    -   Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject → Caused by installing numpy 2.3.3 
    alongside precompiled Anaconda packages (spacy, h5py, thinc) built against NumPy 1.x headers.

Solutions Moving Forward:
1) Build in a virtual environment then pivot to dockerizing it by simply locking all our dependancies
2) We had conflicting Binaries w the Anconda global base library and our SDK tried installing modern packages which resulted in a binary 
mismatch so we nuked the currupted virtual environment and set up a new one with upgraded tooling

1) Build a Data Plane layer
- We alr have a prototype working for this its a simple Flask proxy that intercepts
- Scanner Orchestration if memory serves me right Firewalls can detect types of malware and judge accordingly
    -Secrets
    -Jailbreak
    -Prompt Injection
2) Verdict + Audit
- Rules based way to block warn or allow 
- Log results


concept now working at the data pipeline layer

ci pipeline is used to flag data that is vulnerable
think prompts 
-static scans at code prompt layer
proxy layer is agent to agent communication think rag pipelines mcp servers and other data pipelines that communicate to some agent

promptguard 2 feels like a black box which is slowing progress
- currently we need to fine tune prompt guard 2 for ghost ai, run in both ci and proxy
- add alignment check in the proxy layer to check for chain of thought jailbreaks, alignment check is a sequence level checker rather than text classification so very much tune needed

Runtime Proxy vs Pre-Commit CI

CI:
Acts as the development gatekeeper before code/prompts/data make it into production:
Scan prompts, configs, datasets, and test traces in repos at PR/commit time.
Run PromptGuard2 at lower thresholds → catch more suspicious inputs, even if false positives.
Optionally run AlignmentCheck on synthetic agent traces defined in tests/evals (static replay).
Run regex/entropy detectors aggressively → flag secrets, obfuscation, suspicious tokens.
Block merges that contain unsafe or injection-prone data.
Provide developer-facing explanations so engineers fix issues before shipping


Proxy:
Filter real-time traffic (user prompts, RAG results, plugin/MCP calls).
Low latency scanning → decisions must be made in milliseconds.
Run PromptGuard2 at higher thresholds → block obvious jailbreaks, minimize false positives for end users.
Run AlignmentCheck on live traces → detect agent drift, goal hijacking, chain-of-thought injection attempts.
Optionally integrate CodeShield → block insecure code generations before execution.
Log + alert → suspicious but borderline cases get logged for review, not always blocked


1. DB + Scanning

-Create scan_results + scan_breakdowns tables (repo, file, severity, score, flags, breakdowns).

-Add source column (ours, gitleaks, trufflehog).

-Create scan_labels table for TP/FP feedback.

-Run our scanner on full repo → ingest JSON into Postgres.

-Run Gitleaks + TruffleHog + Secret Scanner in parallel → normalize into same schema.

2. Consensus + Labeling

-Consensus: ≥2 tools flag → likely TP.

-Unique: 1 tool flag → needs review.

-Auto-suppress: FP labels apply across future runs by fingerprint.

-UI/CLI lets devs mark TP/FP.

-Store labels → suppress repeats → export dataset for analysis.

3. AI + Observability + Integration

-Analyze labeled data for weak detectors (e.g., entropy high FP rate).

-Train simple classifier (detector, entropy, line_count, keywords).

-Later: embeddings (pgvector) for similarity search → suggest FP/TP.

-Dashboard: TP/FP ratio, detector precision, repo severity, leak velocity.

-Drilldown: detector/repo findings.

-Integrate as post-SAST guardrail in pre-commit/CI (don’t replace SAST).

Steps RN for DLP Project:

1. Automate DB creation by calling cli on prompts
2. Create prompts, we create to test edge cases and issue bury it fuzzy it, bullet proof
3. Failure == Good (Have AI give sus/obvious) -> DLP sus prompts and store the score
    - Steps DB + Automate + Log Results
    - Basic sleep and have it run

Final is gonna be integrating DLP in the pre commit pipeline!


Goal add to become a SAST guardrail, dont become a SAST hybrid but simply add a check after SAST scans to check for data leaks so run this on a sast scan and the
