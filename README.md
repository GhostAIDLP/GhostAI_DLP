# GhostAI_DLP üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîê

A developer-first **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** tool for detecting risky patterns in code.  
Built with Flask + Python CLI.

---

## üìå Roadmap
- ‚úÖ CLI-based detection engine (secrets, blobs, entropy)
- ‚è≥ Pre-commit + GitHub CI integration
- ‚è≥ AI post-processing filter to reduce false positives
- ‚è≥ SaaS dashboard for org-wide reporting

---

## ‚ö° CLI Usage (Important!)

The CLI lives under `src/cli/`.  
Because this project uses packages (`src/`), you must run the CLI with Python‚Äôs **module flag** (`-m`) from the **project root**.

### üîπ Interactive Mode
Paste multiline code and analyze it interactively:

```bash
python3 -m src.cli.cli

Enter a code prompt (or type 'exit' to quit): // detector test: obvious AWS creds (FAKE ONLY)
Enter the next line (or press Enter to submit): const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
...

{
    "score": 0.98,
    "severity": "high",
    "breakdown": [
        { "name": "secrets", "score": 0.9, "reasons": ["aws_access_key detected"] },
        { "name": "keywords", "score": 0.6, "reasons": ["keyword_secret detected"] }
    ]
}
The CLI sends the snippet to the Flask API and prints a JSON result with:

score

severity

breakdown of detectors triggered

## 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Check with:

```bash
python3 --version

If you don‚Äôt have Python installed, download it from python.org/downloads
.

Also ensure pip (Python‚Äôs package manager) is installed:

pip --version

2. Install Virtual Environment

Install virtualenv if it‚Äôs not already available:

pip install virtualenv

3. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project directory and run:

python3 -m venv venv

This will create a folder named venv/ that contains your isolated environment.

4. Activate the Virtual Environment

Linux / macOS:

source .venv/bin/activate

Windows (PowerShell):

.venv\Scripts\activate

When activated, you‚Äôll see (venv) in your terminal prompt.

To deactivate at any time:

deactivate

5. Install Flask

With the environment activated, install Flask:

- pip install flask

Confirm installation:

- pip show flask

Install all the needed dependencies using requirements.txt:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application from root folder:

- flask --app src/api/routers/risk run 

Flask will run on:

- http://127.0.0.1:5000

Visit this URL in your browser to see your app.

7. Using Flask CLI

Flask comes with a built-in command-line tool. With your virtual environment activated, you can access it directly.

Check available commands:

flask --help

To run your app with the CLI, set the FLASK_APP environment variable:

Linux / macOS:

export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run

Windows (PowerShell):

$env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
flask run

This will start the Flask server the same way as running python app.py.

8. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When finished, deactivate the environment:

deactivate
